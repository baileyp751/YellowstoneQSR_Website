      <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        <h3>1. What are the responsibilities?</h3>
        <p>
          Once a week completing a travel path of a certain section of the store.
          Completion of basic troubleshooting on smaller issues.
          A monthly call to answer any questions anyone has about their restaurants.
          Lastly, ensuring tickets are always put in for any technology issues.
        </p>

        <h3>2. What qualifications do I need?</h3>
        <p>
          Be an active and good employee in the restaurant, and approval from your GM.
          Those are the only qualifications. All training needed will be completed by you
          if you are selected for your store.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Do I have to be a manager/Crew Trainer?</h3>
        <p>
          No, this role is open to anyone interested.
        </p>

        <h3>4. What happens after I fill out the form?</h3>
        <p>
          You will be emailed with a scheduled interview to ask some questions and gauge
          your interest. If selected, you will receive an additional email detailing how
          to complete your training.
        </p>

        <h3>5. How long do I have to complete the training?</h3>
        <p>
          Once selected, you will have one month from that date to complete OTP 1 and 2.
          Both are relatively short.
